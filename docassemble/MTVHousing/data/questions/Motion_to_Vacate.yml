question: |
 Removing a default judgment 
subquestion: |
 If you got a Judgment of Summary Process by Default, it means you missed an eviction hearing and {the plaintiff} won their case to evict you.
 
  [${intro_image.show(width='35em')}](${intro_image.url_for()})
 
  You can ask the court to take back the decision to let the plaintiff evict you if: 
  
  * you missed the hearing for a good reason, and
  *	you also have {a defense} for why your landlord should not evict you.

  We can help you file a Motion to Remove Default and Vacate Judgment.   If the court allows your motion, you start your eviction case over, from the beginning.
  
  You need your Judgment of Summary Process by Default in front of you to complete this motion. 
 
 Do you have your Judgment in front of you?

  Your Answer can also include {counterclaims} you may have against your landlord.

    You can sue your landlord for money as part of your eviction case if your claims are related to your tenancy. These claims are called "counterclaims" if you raise them during an eviction case. They are claims for money. Common counterclaims tenants can bring against their landlord in an eviction case are:
    
    * Your landlord does not keep your apartment in good condition.
    * Your landlord interferes with your use and enjoyment of your apartment or your utilities.
    * Your landlord has not obeyed the security deposit law.
