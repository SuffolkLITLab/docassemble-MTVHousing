 # Removing a Default Judgment 
subquestion: |
 If you missed your eviction trial, your landlord won the case automatically, by default. And the judge gave your landlord permission to evict you. 
  
  You can ask the court to give you another trial and take back the decision to let your landlord evict you if: 
  
  * you missed the trial for a good reason, and
  * you also have a good explanation for why your landlord should not evict you.
  
  If you can show you had a good reason and a good explanation, file a Motion to Remove Default and Vacate Judgment to ask the court to schedule another trial.
  
  You will need your default judgment to answer the questions that help you fill out your motion.

question: |
  Did you get a notice from a sheriff or constable that says you will be "removed"?
subquestion: |
  This is a notice that says a sheriff or constable have scheduled a date and time to move you and your things out of your home.
  
  If you got one of these notices, you can ask the judge to give you more time before the sheriff or constable moves you out. This is called asking for a "stay of execution."

question: |
  Did you already file an Answer with the court?
subquestion: |
  **What is an Answer?**
  
  An Answer is a document you file with the court that explains why you should not be evicted.  Your Answer can also include {counterclaims} you may have against your landlord.
  
  Did you already file one?
yesno: answer_yesno
terms:
  counterclaims: |
    You can sue your landlord for money as part of your eviction case if your claims are related to your tenancy. These claims are called "counterclaims" if you raise them during an eviction case. They are claims for money. Common counterclaims tenants can bring against their landlord in an eviction case are:
    
    * Your landlord does not keep your apartment in good condition.
    * Your landlord interferes with your use and enjoyment of your apartment or your utilities.
    * Your landlord has not obeyed the security deposit law.
