 # Removing a Default Judgment 
subquestion: |
 ## If you missed your eviction trial, you can try to get another one.
 
 This is called a Motion to Remove Default and Vacate Judgment
 
 A Default Judgment is a legal term meaning that you failed to appear at your eviction trial and that your landlord won the case via default and can now evict you from his property.
 
 If you have a **good reason** for missing the court date and a **legal defense that may prevent your eviction** you can ask the judge to schedule another trial
 
 Please note: You should NOT use this form if you have defaulted on a motion after having signed an agreement. If that is your situation you can consider filing a Motion for Reconsideration or a Motion for Rehearing.
 
 PLEASE PROCEED WITH THE INTERVIEW IF THIS APPLIES TO YOU
