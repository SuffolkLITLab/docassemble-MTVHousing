question: |
  Removing a Default Judgment 
subquestion: |
  If you missed your eviction trial, your landlord won the case automatically, by default. And the judge gave your landlord permission to evict you. 
  
  You can ask the court to give you another trial and take back the decision to let your landlord evict you if: 
  
  * you missed the trial for a good reason, and
  * you also have a good explanation for why your landlord should not evict you.
  
  If you can show you had a good reason and a good explanation, file a {Motion to Remove Default and Vacate Judgment} to ask the court to schedule another trial. 
  
  Note: It is best to file this motion within 11 days of the trial date you missed. You can still file if it is later, but you have more rights if you file within the 11 days. 
 
  **Important:**
  You cannot use this motion if already signed an agreement and "defaulted on a motion." 
  
  If that is your situation you can consider filing a Motion for Reconsideration or a Motion for Rehearing.
